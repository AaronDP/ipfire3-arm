description
	Libnet is an API to help with the construction and handling of \
	network packets. It provides a portable framework for low-level \
	network packet writing and handling (use libnet in conjunction \
	with libpcap and you can write some really cool stuff). Libnet \
	includes packet creation at the IP layer and at the link layer \
	as well as a host of supplementary and complementary functionality.
