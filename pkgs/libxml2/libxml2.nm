define PKG_DESCRIPTION
	This library allows to manipulate XML files. It includes support \
	to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. There is DTDs support \
	this includes parsing and validation even with complex DtDs, either \
	at parse time or later once the document has been modified. The output \
	can be a simple SAX stream or and in-memory DOM like representations. \
	In this case one can use the built-in XPath and XPointer implementation \
	to select subnodes or ranges. A flexible Input/Output mechanism is \
	available, with existing HTTP and FTP modules and combined to an URI \
	library.
