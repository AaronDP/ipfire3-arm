PKG_SUMMARY    = An XML parser library.

define PKG_DESCRIPTION
	This is expat, the C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark. Expat \
	is a stream oriented XML parser. This means that you register handlers with \
	the parser prior to starting the parse. These handlers are called when the \
	parser discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed. A \
	start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may \
	register handlers.
