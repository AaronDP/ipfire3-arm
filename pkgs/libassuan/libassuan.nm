define PKG_DESCRIPTION
	The Libassuan package contains an IPC library used by some of the other \
	GnuPG related packages. Libassuan's primary use is to allow a client to \
	interact with a non-persistent server. Libassuan is not, however, limited \
	to use with GnuPG servers and clients. It was designed to be flexible \
	enough to meet the demands of many transaction based environments with \
	non-persistent servers.
