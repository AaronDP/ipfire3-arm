define PKG_DESCRIPTION
	Ghostscript is a package of software that provides:\
	\
	* An interpreter for the PostScript (TM) language, with the ability to \
	  convert PostScript language files to many raster formats, view them \
	  on displays, and print them on printers that don't have PostScript \
	  language capability built in; \
	* An interpreter for Portable Document Format (PDF) files, with the \
	  same abilities; \
	* The ability to convert PostScript language files to PDF (with some \
	  limitations) and vice versa; and \
	* A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement the \
	  graphics and filtering (data compression / decompression \
	  / conversion) capabilities that appear as primitive operations in \
	  the PostScript language and in PDF.
