PKG_SUMMARY    = A text file browser similar to more, but better.

PKG_BUILD_DEPS+= ncurses-devel pcre-devel

define PKG_DESCRIPTION
	The less utility is a text file browser that resembles more, but has \
	more capabilities. Less allows you to move backwards in the file as \
	well as forwards. Since less doesn't have to read the entire input file \
	before it starts, less starts up more quickly than text editors (for \
	example, vi).
