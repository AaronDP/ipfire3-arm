summary    = Powerful light-weight programming language.

description
	Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for \
	extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a \
	general-purpose, stand-alone language. Lua is free software. \
	Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description \
	constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua \
	is dynamically typed, interpreted from bytecodes, and has automatic \
	memory management with garbage collection, making it ideal for \
	configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.
