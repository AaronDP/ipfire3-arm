define PKG_DESCRIPTION
	The flex program generates scanners. Scanners are programs which can \
	recognize lexical patterns in text. Flex takes pairs of regular \
	expressions and C code as input and generates a C source file as \
	output.  The output file is compiled and linked with a library to \
	produce an executable.  The executable searches through its input for \
	occurrences of the regular expressions. When a match is found, it \
	executes the corresponding C code. Flex was designed to work with \
	both Yacc and Bison, and is used by many programs as part of their \
	build process.
