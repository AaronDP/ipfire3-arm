define PKG_DESCRIPTION
	The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) is a library for the manipulation of \
	(not necessarily closed) convex polyhedra and other numerical \
	abstractions.  The applications of convex polyhedra include program \
	analysis, optimized compilation, integer and combinatorial \
	optimization and statistical data-editing.  The Parma Polyhedra \
	Library comes with several user friendly interfaces, is fully dynamic \
	(available virtual memory is the only limitation to the dimension of \
	anything), written in accordance to all the applicable standards, \
	exception-safe, rather efficient, thoroughly documented, and free \
	software.  This package provides all what is necessary to run \
	applications using the PPL through its C and C++ interfaces.
