define PKG_DESCRIPTION
	A GNU implementation of the traditional UNIX macro processor. M4 is \
	useful for writing text files which can be logically parsed, and is \
	used by many programs as part of their build process.  M4 has \
	built-in functions for including files, running shell commands, \
	doing arithmetic, etc. The autoconf program needs m4 for generating \
	configure scripts, but not for running configure scripts.
