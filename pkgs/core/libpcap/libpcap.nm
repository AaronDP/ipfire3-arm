PKG_BUILD_DEPS+= bison flex libnl-devel

define PKG_DESCRIPTION
	Libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network \
	monitoring.  Libpcap can provide network statistics collection, \
	security monitoring and network debugging.  Since almost every \
	system vendor provides a different interface for packet capture, \
	the libpcap authors created this system-independent API to ease in \
	porting and to alleviate the need for several system-dependent \
	packet capture modules in each application.
