define PKG_DESCRIPTION
	Secure, fast, compliant and very flexible web-server which has been optimized \
	for high-performance environments. It has a very low memory footprint compared \
	to other webservers and takes care of cpu-load. Its advanced feature-set \
	(FastCGI, CGI, Auth, Output-Compression, URL-Rewriting and many more) make \
	it the perfect webserver-software for every server that is suffering load \
	problems.
