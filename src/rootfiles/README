## In Version 3 of IPFire we introduce a new storage model of the rootfiles. ##



I.	There are three folders:

	src/rootfiles/core
		... which stores the packages that will be in the iso.
	src/rootfiles/extra
		... for each file in here, we run the packager.


II.	Naming of the files:

	Every file has two or three parts in his name:

		02.binutils
		|  `-- Name of the package (must be the same as the script in lfs/.)
		`----- Order of the stage.

		02.gcc.1
		       `-- If there is a PASS= variable, this is the value of it.

	Some packages may be runned twice or more times during the
	build process. Because there are some new parts of the scripts
	that can auto-update the rootfiles, we now need to handle each pass
	by its own.


III.	Special namespaces:

	There may be some files that are created by the make.sh script.
	To handle them we can use the prefix 00.XXX.
