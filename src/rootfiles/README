## In Version 3 of IPFire we introduce a new storage model of the rootfiles. ##



I.	There are three folders:

	src/rootfiles/core
		... which stores the packages that will be in the iso.
	src/rootfiles/extra
		... for each file in here, we run the packager.
	src/rootfiles/debug
		... which stores the files that only will be included if
		BUILD_DEBUG is enabled in .config.

    Additionally, we have subfolders for earch TARGET. That is because
    some packages have files in some arches, but don't have them in other ones.

II.	Naming of the files:

	Every file has two parts in his name:

		binutils
		   `-- Name of the package (must be the same as the script in lfs/.)

		gcc.p1
		       `-- If there is a PASS= variable, this is the value of it.

	Some packages may be runned twice or more times during the
	build process. Because there are some new parts of the scripts
	that can auto-update the rootfiles, we now need to handle each pass
	by its own.


III.	Special namespaces:

	There may be some files that are created by the make.sh script.
	To handle them we can use the suffix XXX.p0.
